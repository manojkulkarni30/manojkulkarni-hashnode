## Introduction:

In this article, we will explore the process of incorporating images into a Flutter application, enhancing its visual appeal and user experience.

## How To Use Image From Asset Folder?

* Let‚Äôs create a Flutter project by executing below command in terminal.
    
    ```bash
    flutter create my_image_app
    ```
    
* Navigate to the project folder by executing below command.
    
    ```bash
    cd my_image_app
    ```
    
* Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
    
* Create a folder called **asset** in project‚Äôs root directory and add images to that folder.
    
* Now open up `pubspec.yaml` file, add the path of our images under **assets** section as shown below.
    
    ```yaml
    flutter:
      assets:
        - assets/<filename-with-extension>
    ```
    
* If you have multiple images, then just specify the directory name as shown below and save the changes.
    
    ```yaml
    flutter:
      assets:
        - assets/
    ```
    
* Open up **main.dart** file and use **Image.asset** widget to display the image from asset folder as shown below.
    
    ```dart
    class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
      const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});
    
      final String title;
    
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,
            title: Text(title),
          ),
          body: Center(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: <Widget>[Image.asset('assets/<filename-with-extension>')],
            ),
          ),
        );
      }
    }
    ```
    
* Save the changes and let‚Äôs run the application.
    
* Image will get displayed as shown below.

## How To Use Image From Internet?

* Displaying an image from internet is super easy. Instead of **Image.asset** widget, we use **Image.network** widget and instead of **image path**, we use **image URL** as shown below.
    
    ```dart
    class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
      const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});
    
      final String title;
    
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,
            title: Text(title),
          ),
          body: Center(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: <Widget>[Image.network('<image-url>')],
            ),
          ),
        );
      }
    }
    ```
    
* Save the changes and run the application.
    

## How To Add Filtering Effect To An Image?

The Image widget has various properties that you can use to customize the look of an image. For instance, you can change the width and height of the image, as well as apply a filtering effect.

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});

  final String title;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,
        title: Text(title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Image.asset(
              'assets/<filename-with-extension>',
              width: 400,
              height: 400,
              color: Colors.amber,
              colorBlendMode: BlendMode.darken,
            )
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Save the changes and let‚Äôs run the application. The image will look like this:
