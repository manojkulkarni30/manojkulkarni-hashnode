## Introduction:

In this article, we will explore the process of creating a new Flutter project using Android Studio.

## Prerequisites:

Make sure you have **Flutter SDK** and **Android Studio** installed on your machine. If not, I have already created a beginner friendly guide for the same. Please visit this link [https://manojkulkarni.hashnode.dev/ready-to-become-a-flutter-developer-heres-how-to-build-your-first-app](https://manojkulkarni.hashnode.dev/ready-to-become-a-flutter-developer-heres-how-to-build-your-first-app) for more details.

To create a Flutter project using Android Studio, we need to install the **Flutter Plugin for Android Studio**. To do this, open Android Studio, select the **Plugins** option in the sidebar, and ensure the **Marketplace** tab is selected, as shown below.

I have already installed the Flutter plugin for Android Studio, which is why there is a ✅ next to the Flutter plugin, as shown in the image above. You will see an **Install** button. Click on the Install button to add the Flutter plugin to Android Studio. This will also install the Dart plugin. Once installed, you will find these plugins under the **Installed** tab, as shown below.
