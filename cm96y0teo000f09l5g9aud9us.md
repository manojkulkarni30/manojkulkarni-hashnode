## Steps:

* Open up terminal and switch to **beta** channel using below command.
    
    ```bash
    flutter channel beta
    ```
    
* Execute below command to get the latest update available on **beta** channel.
    
    ```bash
    flutter upgrade
    ```
    
* Make sure you have the version **3.31** or above installed on your machine.
    
* Open up Flutter project in VS Code.
    
* Now run the Flutter project by executing below command in terminal.
    
    ```bash
    flutter run -d chrome --web-experimental-hot-reload
    ```
    
* `--web experimental-hot-reload` is the new flag that we need to add to enable hot reload in beta for Flutter web.
    
* After running the application, make a UI change and hit `r` in terminal to reload the change in Flutter web application.
    
* Or just add the below configuration in launch.json file and hit `F5` to run the application.
    
    ```json
        {
                "name": "Flutter for web (hot reloadable)",
                "type": "dart",
                "request": "launch",
                "program": "lib/main.dart",
                "args": [
                  "-d",
                  "chrome",
                  "--web-experimental-hot-reload",
                ]
            }
    ```
    
* Your Flutter application is now running with hot reload enabled for Flutter web in beta. This means faster iterations and smoother development process.
