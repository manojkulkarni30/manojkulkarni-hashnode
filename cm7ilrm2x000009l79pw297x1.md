## Introduction:

In this article, we will explore how to connect a real Android device to our computer wirelessly and use the connected device for debugging purposes.

## Prerequisite:

* Your android device and computer are connected to same WIFI network.
    
* Your Android device has Developer Options enabled. If you’re curious about how to enable it, check out my blog post titled [How To Deploy Flutter Application On Real Android Device](https://manojkulkarni.hashnode.dev/how-to-deploy-flutter-application-on-real-android-device).
    

## Steps:

* Open up **Settings** app on your android device.
    
* Go to **Developer Options**.
    
* Make sure the **Developer Options** is turned on.
    
* Under Developer Options find **Wireless Debugging** option and click on it.

    Open up terminal and execute below command in the terminal.
    
* ```dart
    adb connect <ip_address>:<port_number>
    ```
    
* In above command, use the IP address and port number mentioned on Wireless debugging screen.
    
* After successful execution of above command, you can now use your android device for debugging purpose in Visual Studio Code.
