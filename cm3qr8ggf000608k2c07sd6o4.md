## Introduction:

In this article, we will explore a quick and easy method to mirror your iPhone screen to a Mac using **macOS Sequoia**.

iPhone mirroring is a highly valuable tool for developers, particularly mobile application developers like myself. It significantly aids mobile application development in numerous ways, such as:

* While developing the user interface (UI) for a mobile application, developers can mirror the iPhone to a Mac and observe how the UI changes appear in real time without the need to repeatedly pick up the physical device.
    
* As a developer, once a feature is implemented, we showcase it to stakeholders to gather feedback. Using iPhone mirroring, we effortlessly demonstrate the app’s features on a large screen, simplifying communication and facilitating feedback collection.
    

## Problem With Existing Approach:

I used Quick Time Player to mirror my iPhone to my Mac machine. However, it has a few limitations.

* I have to connect my iPhone to my Mac machine using USB-C cable.
    
* I successfully mirrored my iPhone screen onto my Mac, but I couldn’t control it. I still had to perform the operation on my physical device. The screen was only displaying in view mode.
    

## Solution: Seamless Wireless Mirroring with macOS Sequoia's iPhone Mirroring App

Now with **macOS Sequoia** 15 Apple has introduced a new application called **iPhone mirroring**. It’s a pre installed applications that comes with macOS Sequoia 15 or later.

With iPhone mirroring, we can mirror our iPhone wirelessly and also control it without needing to constantly pick up the physical device. It works offline as well. No need for an active internet connection.

3There are some system requirements to make this work:

* Mac machine should be Apple silicon based or with Apple T2 Security chip and running macOS Sequoia 15 or later.
    
* iPhone that we want to mirror should be running iOS 18 or later.
    
* Mac and iPhone should be signed with same Apple account.
    
* Mac and iPhone have bluetooth and wifi turned on.
    
* iPhone should be locked and near by your Mac.

You can fully control the device. Open applications, remove applications, arrange apps, type using your Mac keyboard, open app switcher and close applications and scroll using your mouse wheel.

We can even drag and drop files between iPhone and Mac machine directly. (**Note:** I have tried currently only with Notes app)

There are some keyboard shortcuts to easily navigate iPhone like:

* ⌘ 1 : Go to Home Screen
    
* ⌘ 2 : App Switcher
    
* ⌘ 3: Open Spotlight
    
* ⌘ + : To increase the window size
    
* ⌘ - : To decrease the window size
    
* ⌘ 0 : To display actual window size
    

When you mirror your iPhone to your Mac, you’ll see this notification on your iPhone.
