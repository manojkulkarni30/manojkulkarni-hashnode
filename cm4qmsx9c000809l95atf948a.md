## Introduction:

In this article, we will guide you through the step-by-step process of updating the Flutter SDK to the latest version.

## How To Check Current Flutter SDK Version:

To check current Flutter SDK version follow below steps:

* Open up terminal and execute below command in terminal.
    
    ```bash
    flutter --version
    ```
    
* Output of above command will indicate the current Flutter SDK version installed on your machine along with Flutter channel through which it is installed as shown below

* As per the output we have **Flutter SDK 3.24.5 installed on our machine through stable channel**.
    

## What Are Different Flutter Channels?

Now, let’s execute below command in terminal to see the list of available Flutter channels.

```bash
flutter channel
```

Below is the output of above command.

As per the output, we can see that Flutter has four channels: Stable, Beta, Main & Master. Asterisk sign near Stable channel indicate that Stable channel is being currently used.

Now let’s understand what these channels exactly means:

* `Stable`: Recommended for new users and production app releases, updated every three months with occasional hot fixes.
    
* `Beta`: It is recommended for experienced users. This channel receives monthly updates which are heavily tested and verified against Google products built with flutter internally.
    
* `Main & Master`: This channel is generally used by people who are contributing to Flutter. Also it is not throughly tested as beta and stable channel.
    

Now, if you want to switch to other channel, you can execute below command in terminal.

```bash
flutter channel beta
```

Above command will switch to beta channel. We will stick with `Stable` channel for upgrade process.

## How To Update Flutter SDK To Latest Version?

Now, to update the Flutter SDK to latest version, execute below command in terminal.

```bash
flutter upgrade
```

This command will update the Flutter SDK to the latest version. Upgrade process may take some time, depending on your internet connection speed.

During the upgrade process, it will also execute `flutter doctor` command to make sure our development environment is still intact and everything is good as shown below.

As per above screenshot, our Flutter SDK version is updated to latest version **3.27.0**.
